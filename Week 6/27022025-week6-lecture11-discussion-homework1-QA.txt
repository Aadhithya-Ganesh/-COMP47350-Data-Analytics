Lecture structure:
===================

Part1:  QA for lecture on normalisation, binning, sampling.

Part2: Discussion on Homework1 requirements and QA.

Key points to discuss:
+Submit a single zip archive, please note the naming of this archive as suggested in Homework1 description.
+Make sure to include your dataset used for all the analysis and cleaning. Check list on the Homework1 page: https://brightspace.ucd.ie/d2l/le/lessons/301120/topics/3559948
+Include a single Jupyter notebook and your dataset.
+Include as separate files: DQR and DQP as PDF files.
+Justify your steps with evidence from the data.
+Data integrity checks.
+Document all actions you take in the DQP.
+Save the final cleaned dataset. No Null or NA data should still be present in the cleaned dataset.

Part3: Example solution uploaded to Brightspace for a similar project to Homework1. QA about this.

Recap of LinearRegression: in this lab we spend more time on understanding LinearRegression training, prediction 
and evaluation measures for the regression task: RMSE, MAE, R2. No new code or materials, we follow the code from Lab7.

----

This lab follows the slides of Week7 and Week10 which introduce the Linear Regression prediction algorithm and the supporting code provided in the notebook
Lab7-Notebook-Modeling-LinearRegression-sklearn-train-test-categorical-features-evaluation-MSE-MAE-R2.ipynb

Focus:
1. Understanding the linear regression training and prediction steps through Python code and the sklearn library.
2. Understanding model evaluation concepts (eg train/test split) by going through the Lab7 notebook and sample code to work with the Offices dataset.
3. Going through different evaluation measures for regression models, looking at how the trained models behave (wrt prediction error) when using different features.
4. Comparing evaluation measures computed on the training set versus test set, as well as getting familiar with code for evaluation using cross-validation.

This lab introduces the Decision Tree and the RandomForest algorithm in the supporting code provided in the notebook:
Lab11-Notebook-ModelingEvaluation-DecisionTree-RandomForest.ipynb

Focus:
1. Understanding the DecisionTree and RandomForest algorithms through Python code and relevant libraries.

2. Understanding and practicing training, feature importance, predicting and evaluating with Decision Tree (DT); this is the base model for building an ensemble model called Random Forest (RF).

3. Understanding and practicing training, feature importance, predicting and evaluating with Random Forest (RF). Evaluation of RF models using: train/test error vs cross-validation error vs out-of-sample error (the OOS score or also called out-of-bag OOB evaluation score is specific only to RF models).

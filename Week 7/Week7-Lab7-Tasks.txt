This lab follows the slides of Week7 which introduce the Linear Regression prediction algorithm and the supporting code provided in the notebook
Lab7-Notebook-Modeling-LinearRegression-sklearn-train-test-categorical-features-evaluation-MSE-MAE-R2.ipynb

Focus:
1. Understanding the linear regression training and prediction steps through Python code and the sklearn library.

2. Understanding model evaluation concepts (eg train/test split and prediction error measure) by going through the Lab7 notebook and sample code to work with the Offices.csv dataset.

3. Going through different evaluation measures for regression models, looking at how the trained models behave (wrt prediction error) when using different features.

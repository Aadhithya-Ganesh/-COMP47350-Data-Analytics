This lab introduces the Logistic Regression algorithm and provides supporting code in the notebook
Lab9-Notebook-Modeling-ClassificationTask-LogisticRegression-scikitlearn.ipynb

Focus:
1. Understanding the logistic regression training and prediction steps through Python code and relevant libraries.
2. Understanding model evaluation concepts for classification (eg train/test split) by going through the Lab9 notebook and sample code to work with the Offices dataset.
3. Going through different evaluation measures for classification models, looking at how the trained models behave (wrt classification evaluation measures) when using different features.
4. Comparing evaluation measures computed on the training set versus test set, as well as getting familiar with code for evaluation of classification models using cross-validation.
